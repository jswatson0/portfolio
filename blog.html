          This summer marks the beginning of my transition into the exciting career field of <a title="computer programming " href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming" target="_blank">computer programming </a> and <a title="web development" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development" target="_blank">web development</a>... is something I can now say with a straight, yet enthusiastic face.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't until very recently that I decided not only is this something I could do, but this is something I want to do. Growing up, I had every opportunity to learn computer science, but was completely uninterested. I figured it wasn't for me and I could get by learning as little about computers and their processes as possible. I adopted an outlook early in life and it contributed greatly to later decisions. Out of high school, I decided to major in music education, consciously steering away from math and science. When deciding on my career field as part of my enlistment in the Air Force, I avoided the multitudes of IT and computer oriented jobs available. I chose instead to be a <a title="HH-60 PAVEhawk" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikorsky_HH-60_Pave_Hawk" target="_blank">helicopter</a> mechanic, because in my mind maintaining an aircraft seemed less intimidating than working with a computer.

          My final stand against learning anything more than a surface level interaction with computers came when I returned to college and chose to major in history.  After I graduated and began my job search, it was impossible to ignore the demand for computer programming skills (somehow I had managed to ignore it until this point)  and I finally had the confidence to decide that this was something I could learn and be successful at.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't spend much time regretting the fact that I didn't get on the computer programming track earlier.  I know my previous experiences will provide a stable foundation for building a new skill set, and there is no time to waste with so much to learn.
