          <a style="color:blue"href="http://www.themakersquare.com/web/course" target="_blank">MakerSquare</a> is a 10 week immersive web development training program.  The goal is to provided students with the tools and experiences needed to build web applications from front to back.  Curriculum is project based and pair programming is stressed as an important tool in the development process.  
        </p>
        <p>
          While the name of this program may seem abstract at first, it really is a concise description of what we do on a daily basis at MakerSquare HQ.  Whether we are learning programming languages such as Ruby and JavaScript or the frameworks and libraries that add functionality to them, the goal is to develop a toolbox that will enable us to become makers of dynamic websites and functional web applications.  While learning to be effective makers we are shown the importance of utilizing our community as a resource.  Between pair programming with classmates and being introduced to working developers as mentors and advisors, the comparison to a town square emerges.  This is why our downtown Austin HQ is essentially a square of makers.

          <h4>Why am I doing it?</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          Web developers are creative problem solvers in high demand, working in the most collaborative and powerful information and commerce environment known, the INTERNET. The amount of data available on the web through various API's is incredible, what can be done with this data, mind blowing! As a web developer, my goal is to make the most of these resources and contribute to the age of information.    
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I opened my mind to computer programming the possibilities of what I could accomplish could not be ignored, I was 100% focused on finding a place for myself in software engineering.  Luckily for me this was not a new concept to many of my acquaintances.  The more I asked around, the more I found people who were not only willing but excited to help me on my way to learning this skill set.  After months of using online resources to familiarize myself with programming languages and computer science in general, a developer friend of mine directed me to the MakerSquare web site.  It was as if someone had read my mind and pieced together the exact learning experience I was looking for.  Going through the application process helped to narrow my focus in my individual learning efforts and I became solely focused on web development as my path in software engineering.    
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>What do I want to do next?</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          At MakerSquare I am studying with a talented and creative group of 27 classmates who come from varied backgrounds. I am doing my best to take in as much as I can to be as employable as possible by the end of the course.  While I have ideas of my own for applications that could be useful or fun, my ideal position leaving MakerSquare would be a support role in developing a product or service that had already attracted a team of passionate engineers who I could assist and learn from.

        <p>
          This summer marks the beginning of my transition into the exciting career field of computer programming and web development... is something I can now say with a straight, yet enthusiastic face.
        </p>
        <p>  
          It wasn't until very recently that I decided not only is this something I could do, but this is something I want to do. Growing up, I had every opportunity to learn computer science, but was completely uninterested. I figured it wasn't for me and I could get by learning as little about computers and their processes as possible. I adopted an outlook early in life and it contributed greatly to later decisions. Out of high school, I decided to major in music education, consciously steering away from math and science. When deciding on my career field as part of my enlistment in the Air Force, I avoided the multitudes of IT and computer oriented jobs available. I chose instead to be a helicopter mechanic, because in my mind maintaining an aircraft seemed less intimidating than working with a computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          My final stand against learning anything more than a surface level interaction with computers came when I returned to college and chose to major in history.  After I graduated and began my job search, it was impossible to ignore the demand for computer programming skills (somehow I had managed to ignore it until this point) and I finally had the confidence to decide that this was something I could learn and be successful at.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't spend much time regretting the fact that I didn't get on the computer programming track earlier.  I know my previous experiences will provide a stable foundation for building a new skill set, and there is no time to waste with so much to learn.
